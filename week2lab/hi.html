      Hello, my name is Hanis Batrisyia. I'm quite excited to do this because web programming course seems interesting. There's a lot to say about myself actually, but I will try to make it short. So here it goes. 
    </p>
      <p>
       I started primary school when I was 6 years old. So everytime I entered a new grade, I would always meet friends who are a year older than me. I am very interested in arts. I drew a lot ever since I was a kid because I love the calmness that I feel when I'm drawing, it's just pleasurable. I'm an outdoor person. Every weekend my family and I will go for camping just to release our tension from those stressful days. Although I'm a family person, I also make time for my friends. Sometimes we go for hiking, sometimes we play tourist in Kuala Lumpur, and sometimes we go food hunting. We are just like other teenagers who loves to hangout and have fun. Based on my interests, someone may think that I'm an extrovert. I don't think I'm an extrovert person, though. I think I'm an ambivert. I can be friendly at times, but I can also be quiet in certain environments. It depends.
